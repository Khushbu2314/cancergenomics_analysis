Project name : gene  expression analysis and survival analysis
Introduction:The determination of the pattern of genes expressed at the level of genetic transcription, under specific circumstances or in a specific cell,is called as gene expression analysis.The expression studies are directed to detect and quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of a specific gene.It  comprises from the gene activation until the mature protein is located in its corresponding compartment to perform its function and contribute to the expression of the phenotype of cell.

Survival analysis:It invovles the statistical procedures/methods in the data analytics to find the survival rate of the patient in a particular disease(for example: cancer) 

Here I choose Cervical cancer dataset downloaded from NCBI GEO(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE190075)

1.Normalization:It is a way of organizing a dataset .It removes the redundancy and unstructured data from the dataset.
Thus the dataset was normalized as given below:

2.Heatmap
3.Differential Gene analysis
4.Circos plot
5.SSGSEA
6.Survival analysis
7.Single cell analysis
